goals/concpets:
- can move the ends of links freely, wihtout having to think about where the other end is
- a link contins two ends points
- an end point is just an opaque object, that cn be plugged into various inputs/outputs
- a link has one input, and one output
- for a fusible object, there is an array of inputs, each input is one end point of a link
- for the outputs, there is an array of otuptus, each output is a list of end point objects
- given an endpoint, we can get:
    - the other end of the endpoint, via the link object
    - know where to get/put data, ie which fusible object, which input/output

class Endpoint {
  Link link
  LinkPoint linkpoint
}

class Link {
  input=Endpoint()
  output=Endpoint()
}

class linkpoint {
  EndPoint endpoint
}

class Fusible {
   inputs[] = {linkpoint1, linkpoint2, linkpoint3}
   outputs[] = {linkpoint1, linkpoint2, linkpoint3}
   evaluators[] = {evaluator1, evaluator2, ... }
}

Evaluator {
  forwardExpression,
  backwardExpression,
  numInputs,
  numOutputs
}
